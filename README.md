# Screen Time & Mental Wellness Risk Analysis

## Problem Statement
Modern digital lifestyles involve extensive screen exposure — social media, streaming, gaming, remote work, etc. Excessive screen time is believed to correlate with mental health challenges like stress, anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality. However, many institutions lack data-driven tools to quantify such relationships and predict individuals at mental wellness risk based on their screen usage patterns.

This project aims to build a data-driven machine learning solution to analyze the relationship between screen time metrics and mental wellness indicators (survey responses) to predict mental health risk, identify contributing behavioral factors, and help mental health professionals, institutions, or wellness apps intervene proactively.

## Objectives
- **Build a ML Model**: Classification/Regression to predict mental wellness score or risk class.
- **Identify Key Factors**: Which behaviors (social usage, sleep, etc.) are most predictive.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize correlations, risk segments, and trends.
- **What-If Analysis**: Simulate changes in habits.
- **Web App**: Deployable interface for assessment.

## Project Structure
- `backend/`: Flask application serving the ML model and API.
- `frontend/`: Web application for the user interface.
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training.
- `docs/`: Documentation.

## Roadmap
1. **Data Collection/Generation**: Generate synthetic data representing screen time and mental health indices.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand correlations.
3. **Model Development**: Train models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to predict risk.
4. **Backend API**: Expose model via Flask.
5. **Frontend Application**: Build a responsive UI for the risk assessment tool.
6. **Deployment**: Prepare for deployment.
